# RillaJS
This project is a lightweight Vanilla JavaScript utility that provides shorthand functions for common DOM operations. It simplifies element selection, event handling, and other interactions without relying on external libraries like jQuery.

## Why?
- Reduces repetitive boilerplate code.
- Provides a concise and consistent syntax.
- Makes JavaScript more readable and developer-friendly.

## Build:

Running `merge` will also run `minify` after merging the JS files.

```npm run merge```

```npm run minify```
