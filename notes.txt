$back() - go back in history (window.history.back())
$forward() - go forward in history (window.history.forward())
$reload() - reload page (window.location.reload())
$redirect(url) - navigate to URL (window.location.href = url)

Query/Search utilities:

$query() - get all URL parameters as an object

Browser info:

$userAgent() - get user agent string
$referrer() - get referring URL
$title(newTitle) - get/set page title

Storage helpers:

$cookie(key, value) - get/set cookies (though you mentioned no localStorage/sessionStorage)

$query() - to get all parameters as an object
$redirect(url) - for navigation
$reload() - for page refresh
$title() - for page title management

Would any of these be useful for your utility collection?
